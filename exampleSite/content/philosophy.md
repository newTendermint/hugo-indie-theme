# Philosophy
More than anything else, this writing reflects the way I think and see the world. It’s the best version of myself.

## Motivation
> The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. – Chinese Proverb

I wanted to found a startup, so I did. We joined one of the top accelerators in the US and were about to raise money. It hit me when I realized the insanity of trying to sell a piece of my company to go down the road that is predicated on raising C after B after A. Aggressive standards applied to every company knowing 9 out 10 will fail. I was already working for someone else’s Vision before even starting to create the environment that I believed in so much.

My goals are simple: Be 100% independent from money, time and physical location and create high quality products while working in areas that I enjoy. When I turn 90 I know that time is the single most important resource that I wish I optimized on. Then i imagined my funeral and thought about what the 3 most important people in my life would say about me. I now know what to do.

## Vision
> Logic will get you from A to Z; imagination will get you everywhere. - Albert Einstein

I want to create a psychological safe community where impressive individuals across the globe can connect to realize their vision. Don’t let your vision be dictated from any other entity but your pure mind. I am opinionated and core commandments of this vision are:

We…

**do whatever we want in life**
Stop being a passive observer of your life and act.
**work independently from time and location**
Escape modern prisons and be free.
**learn new things to a level of mastery**
Combine skills to let magic happen.
**approach problems with a beginners mindset**
Don’t apply solutions, de-construct problems.
**generate real recurring revenue from our business**
Money can buy independence and is a means to an end.
**create high quality products**
Lets build great things or leave it.
**are enabled and enable others**
Create a winning environment.
**don’t just check boxes but think and add value**
Think long to generate innovate ideas.
**apply a hacker mindset**
Break things, think out of the box and create systems.
**don't look for the shortcut**
It’s a long and sometimes painful process.
**sustain a healthy lifestyle**
You can’t split your physical and mental health.
**create for a world in the future**
Don’t think now, think in 20 years.
**are positive and don’t get defensive**
Don’t complain, change it.
**don’t try. Do or do not**
There is no try.
**are always awesome**
Every activity trains your brain and forms the synapsis, train awesome, don’t train mediocre.
**get to value as soon as possible**
Optimize time to value.
**unlearn toxic patterns**
We all learned many bad things, lets unlearn.
**are not afraid to fail**
Imagine the worst thing that can happen? Not that bad, huh?
**are open-minded and change perspective**
Take on another perspective, how does the world look like?
**give and take feedback in a respectful manner**
Reflect and become self-aware.
**are open and transparent**
What do you want to hide? Why?
**are not afraid of showing vulnerability**
Vulnerability is real and creates credibility.
**act in a way we won’t regret**
When you are 90, will you regret what you’ve done?
**are willing to adapt and change**
It is not the strongest […] it is the one that is most adaptable to change. - Darwin
**experiment with different ideas and different domains**
Get out of your comfort zone.
**keep a lean mindset**
Analysis paralysis kills you. Be lean. Don’t over engineer.
**challenge ourselves and actively rewire our brains**
Don’t take the status quo for granted.
**enjoy life and have fun**
YOLO.
**limit the time and add constraints**
Stop procrastinating and focus on essentials to get more done.
**don’t find excuses**
Take adversity head on.
**solve real problems**
Make something you can sell, not the other way around.
**think globally and act locally**
Focus on small wins. Build momentum. Then conquer.
**create experiments and validate first**
Otherwise the entire project becomes and experiment.
**have balls & not business plans**
Do it, don’t write another business plan.
**want to be among the top 2**
Nobody remembers the 3rd.
**celebrate failures & enjoy our journey**
It’s the journey and the grind, not the destination.
**are accountable to someone**
Accountability creates results.
**think fast and slow**
Breathe. Think. Analyze. Act informed.
**target a specific narrow audience**
Be the best choice for your audience.
**give before we ask**
Give first, give again, then ask.
**lead by example**
Show don’t tell.
**act out of love, not anxiety**
Always act out of love, not fear.
**focus**
Work on one thing at a time, and one thing only.
**over deliver and delight**
The expected is mediocre.
**use data to inform our decisions**
Instinct is good, data is better.
**don’t bullshit**
Just don’t.
**think and act 10x**
Create something an order of magnitude better.

## Solo
> In a world that is changing so quickly the biggest risk you can take is not taking any risk. - Mark Zuckerberg

It was a willful decision to start as a solopreneur. Here is why:

- No communication overhead and associated costs.
- Time constraints help me to focus and eliminate.
- Accountability buddies and mentors fill the team gap.
- Creating a real business not a job.
- Highest level of automation and efficiency required and desired.
- Independence from money, time and location.

I hope that my statements raised some questions. Please ask.
